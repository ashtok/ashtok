## About Me

Master's student specializing in AI and Deep Learning with **4+ years of professional software engineering experience**. Currently working as a Research Assistant developing multimodal AI systems and interactive visualization tools for XR-based research.

My work focuses on:
- **Multilingual LLM Evaluation** – Benchmarking semantic understanding across 50+ languages
- **Generative AI** – Text-to-image systems with diffusion and autoregressive models
- **Applied ML Research** – Multimodal pipelines combining vision, language, and geometry
- **Production Systems** – Scalable distributed architectures and anomaly detection frameworks
